About the course
----------------
This course will cover the generation and application of large-scale holo-omic data sets, such as those produced within the HoloFood project.

There is an increasing recognition that organisms do not exist in isolation, but are actually holobionts, composed of the host and the many microorganisms found on or in the individual.
The HoloFood project has developed significant multi-omics datasets for both chicken and salmon, with a view to understanding how different feeds impact the gut microbiota, and in turn animal productivity.
This course covers how to access and utilise both raw and derived data products, the workflow to achieve genome-resolved metagenomics, analysis of host variation, generation and interpretation of metabolomic data, and approaches to multi-omic integration to understand links between traits and genomic information.

The HoloFood project represents a cornerstone of hologenomic research, providing a blueprint for how data from such projects should be archived, analysed and interlinked.
As such, the motivation for this course is to highlight the availability and usability of the HoloFood data in further holo-omic analyses, either as reference sets to compare against, or as source data for subsequent novel analysis.


Preparation
-----------
.. important::
   * **You need to bring a laptop with you for the practical sessions.**

   * **You need to install the** `AWS Workspaces Client <https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/>`_.

   Any fairly modern Linux (most distros); Windows (8.1 or 10); MacOS (10.8.1+, ideally 10.12 Sierra+) laptop with WiFi access should be fine. A Chromebook from 2019 or newer is also likely to work. An iPad/Android tablet can theoretically work, if you are used to working on this with a physical keyboard.

   You will use your laptop to access a Virtual Machine, which is already set up with all of the scientific software and data for the course.

   On your laptop, before the course, please download and install the `AWS Workspaces Client <https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/>`_.
   Please try this as soon as possible, in case it isn't compatible with your computer.
   
   Contact the course organisers if you aren't able to install this client software.

   :ref:`See full instructions <vminstructions>`.

For the practical sessions, familiarity with Unix command line use and scripting with R and/or Python will be needed.
These tutorials will be very useful if you are not familiar:

* `Unix Tutorial from Surrey University <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix>`_
* `R Tutorial from RTutor <http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction>`_

For the lectures, the recommended pre-reading list is:

* `Disentangling hostâ€“microbiota complexity through hologenomics <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00421-0>`_
* `Holo-Omics: Integrated Host-Microbiota Multi-omics for Basic and Applied Biological Research <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220306040>`_
* `Applied Hologenomics: Feasibility and Potential in Aquaculture <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779918300015>`_
