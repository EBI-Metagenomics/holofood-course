HoloFood data in public archives – practical session
====================================================

In this hands-on session, we will learn about the 
`HoloFood Data Portal <http://holofooddataportaldev-env.eba-jwzhg3z2.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com>`_ – 
a web resource for finding and using the samples and datasets created by the 
`HoloFood <https://www.holofood.eu>`_ project.

Follow the HoloFood Data Portal tutorial
----------------------------------------
`Open the HoloFood documentation <https://ebi-metagenomics.github.io/holofood-database/tutorial.html>`_, 
and follow the Tutorial.

For the first few learning objectives, you just need to use the 
`HoloFood Data Portal <http://holofooddataportaldev-env.eba-jwzhg3z2.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com>`_.

For the last learning objective, you need to write (or copy) some Python code to fetch data, analyse data, and make a plot.

.. hint::
    There is a Jupyter Notebook available on the course-provided virtual machines, so you don’t need to set up Python or install anything.
    However, to follow this workshop at a later date, see `the github repo <https://github.com/ebi-metagenomics/holofood-course>`_ for installation instructions.

To use the Jupyter Nobteook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Open a Terminal 
- Type the following commands:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    conda activate jupyter
    jupyter lab

Find the "HoloFood Data Portal Tutorial.ipynb" notebook in the lefthand bar. Double-click it.
